# Patches

Here you can find the [patches](../doc/patching.md) and documentation of the different setups used during various performances.

Please note that patches are archived here after the respective performance, but that the EEGsynth code base probably has been developed further after the performance. The patches here might therefore not run out of the box with the latest version of the EEGsynth. If you want to replay one of the patches, you should therefore check/update the respective ini files.
