If you just want to play back a previously recorded control signal, you would start:

1. redis.sh
2. playbackcontrol.sh
3. quantizer.sh
4. outputmidi.sh

To specify the control signals that are played back, you can open
`playbackcontrol.ini` in TextEdit and change the file name. After
changing the ini file, you have to restart the playbackcontrol module.
