# Ableton Loop

_This patch was implemented for the 2020 Ableton Loop event, which had to be canceled due to the corona pandemic. We expect to use this patch for the 2021 Loop event and will continue to develop it._

This directory contains some of the patches for the workshop at [Ableton Loop](https://loop.ableton.com/) in Berlin, April 24â€“26 2020. During the workshop we combine electrophysiological signals from the brain, muscle, eye and heart with electronic music and analog synthesizers.

# Technical details

The patch starts with the signals from a 4-channel [OpenBCI Gangion amplifier](http://www.eegsynth.org/?p=2034). The bipolar ExG channels are connected like this

1. EEG (brain)
2. EMG (muscle)
3. EOG (eye)
4. ECG (heart)

Each of the electrophysiological signals is processed separately using settings optimized for the respective signal characteristics. The combined raw data for the 4 signals is represented in buffer `1972`. The processed data for each type of signal is represented in

4. EEG (brain) in 1973
3. EMG (muscle) in 1974
1. EOG (eye) in 1975
2. ECG (heart) in 1976

The brain and muscle signals are converted into continuous control channels. From the brain signal the different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) are detected. Instantaneous triggers are detected for the eye blinks and heart beats. The heart signal is also converted into a continuous heart rate control channel.
