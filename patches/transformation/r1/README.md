# R1

This is the patch used for the Linux system at the Transformation
performance by Stephen and Samon at R1 in Stockholm on June 1, 2019

We recorded EEG from a single subject using two electrodes on the
back of the head. The patch extracts the alpha amplitude envelope
and uses that to control the modular synthesizer. The patch was
implemented on a Linux Mint laptop, controlling a modular synthesizer
via the Doepfer A-190-3.
