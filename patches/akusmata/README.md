# Akusmata

The performance at [Akusmata](http://akusmata.com/eegsynth-body-music-demonstration-by-oneplusoneisthree-guests/) was performed with both Per and Samon hooked up with their EEG, processed by the EEGsynth on a MacBook Pro and a Dell Linux laptop, respectively. Both laptops were connected to a local network, and the postprocessed control signals of the MacBook Pro were send (via Redis) to the Linux laptop, who provided the MIDI signals for the Endrophines Shuttle Control on one synthesizer. In this way, both EEG's were controlling the patch on one synthesizer.

Additionally, Petri Kuljuntausta and Eleni Tsitsirikou performed as the soloists of the 1+1=3 group.
