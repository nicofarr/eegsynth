# Andoullette

Andoulette was performed with both Per and Samon hooked up with
their EEG to the synthersizers of Jean-Louis and Stephen respectively.
Furthermore, intramuscular EMG was recorded from Per using an analog
Grass amplifier from 1986 and fed as analog signal to one synth,
while surface EMG was recvorded from Samon and fed as analog signal
to the other synth.

The EEGsynth was used with two patches, one for Per running on a
MacBook pro and one for Samon running on a Dell Linux laptop.
