# Installation instructions for Windows

When using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), you would mostly follow the general installation instructions.

## Redis

The only dependency that you would install specifically for Windows is the Redis server. That can be installed using `conda install` like this:

```
conda install -c binstar redis-server # see https://anaconda.org/binstar/redis-server
```
