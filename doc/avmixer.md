# AVmixer

The AVmixer software incorporates a MIDI interface which can pick up software MIDI messages from other software running on the same computer, such as the EEGsynth outputmidi module. The AVmixer MIDI settings panel allows the mapping of the incoming MIDI messages onto software functions. It allows three presets for different MIDI interfaces.

AVmixer can also be controlled using the TouchOSC app, which sends OSC messages that are translated by the [TouchOSC MIDI bridge](http://hexler.net/docs/touchosc-configuration-connections-bridge) into software MIDI commands. AVmixer includes a TouchOSC template layout that is configured to work out of the box with the factory configured presets "3".

You can control the AVmixer software both (and simultaneously) from this EEGsynth module and from the TouchOSC interface.

## MIDI presets

The previous version of AVmixer came with a preset that was suited for the TouchOSC app. The latest version (2.7.1) does not come with any presets. Editing the settings can be done in the MIDI settings" graphical user interface or in the file

## Sending MIDI over the network

You can use CoreMIDI or rtpMIDI support if you want to control the AVmixer software on one computer, while the EEGsynth is running on another computer.
